### ðŸŒŸ **Future Enhancements & Contributions Wanted**

We are constantly working to improve **ModelMorph**, and we invite contributors to help bring these ideas to life! Below are some areas where we see exciting opportunities for improvement and expansion. If any of these resonate with you or you have other ideas, feel free to jump in and help.

#### 1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Develop **unit tests** for each class in the repository using **pytest**.
   - Identify and write tests for modules that currently lack coverage.
   - Focus on high-priority modules such as the **Chat**, **Prompt**, **LLM Integrations**, and **Database Repositories**.
   - Improve **test coverage** to ensure reliability and stability across all components.

#### 2. **More LLM Integrations**
   - **LLAMA Integration**: Add support for the LLAMA models to expand options for LLM users.
   - Explore additional integrations with other popular LLMs to provide even more flexibility for developers.

#### 3. **Expanded Database Support**
   - Add **SQL database integration** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to broaden the options for data storage and management.
   - Support more **NoSQL** and **relational databases** for diverse use cases.

#### 4. **Plugin Development**
   - Develop **actionable plugins** that allow ModelMorph to perform specific tasks. For example:
     - Execute **Python code** within the system for dynamic functionality.
     - Create plugins for **external service integrations** (APIs, webhooks, etc.).
   - Enable a seamless plugin system to allow users to add custom actions easily.

#### 5. **Strengthening the Core**
   - Refine and **solidify the repository** in key areas, such as:
     - Improve code quality and adhere to best practices in software engineering.
     - Simplify configurations and make it easier for developers to extend and integrate their own systems.
     - Enhance the **documentation** and provide clear guidance for contributors, especially in more advanced or custom configurations.

#### 6. **Documentation & Developer Tools**
   - Improve **developer documentation** with more comprehensive setup guides, examples, and tutorials.
   - Expand **example use cases** and provide more detailed use case implementations.
   - Provide **automated deployment guides** for cloud and local environments.
